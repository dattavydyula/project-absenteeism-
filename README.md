This project involves creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze compensation trends and their underlying reasons. By leveraging two datasets—one detailing compensation rates and another categorizing reasons for variations—this dashboard provides stakeholders with actionable insights into key factors influencing compensation. 

# Power BI Dashboard: Compensation Analysis

## Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of compensation trends and reasons for variation. It is designed to help stakeholders understand factors influencing compensation and identify patterns in the data.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic charts, graphs, and tables to explore compensation rates and their distribution.
- **Data Insights:** Identifies key reasons associated with compensation levels.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplified navigation with slicers and filters for custom views.

## Data Sources
- **Primary Data Source:** Two CSV files were used for this analysis:
  - `compensation.csv`: Contains information about compensation per hour.
    - Fields:
      - `ID`: Unique identifier for records.
      - `comp/hr`: Compensation rate per hour.
  - `Reasons.csv`: Includes categories and descriptions of reasons linked to the data.
    - Fields:
      - `Number`: Numerical identifier for the reason.
      - `Reason`: Description of the reason (e.g., diseases, metabolic conditions).

## Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following visual elements:
- **Compensation Distribution Chart:** Visual representation of hourly compensation rates.
- **Reason Analysis Table:** Highlights key reasons influencing compensation trends.
- **Interactive Filters:** Allows users to explore data by specific categories or ranges.

## Insights and Highlights
- The majority of compensation rates fall between $31/hr and $47/hr with the median compensation being $39/hr.
- Certain reasons, such as "Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium" and "Physiotherapy", appear in the data and are associated with compensation trends.
- The data reveals trends in compensation influenced by categories such as laboratory examination, unjustified absence, and health-related reasons, highlighting 
  their role in variations in hourly pay.


## How to Use
1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Interact with the dashboard using slicers and filters to explore different dimensions of the data.
